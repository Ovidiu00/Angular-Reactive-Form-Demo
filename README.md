## About

My preffered pattern for designing a form that coninsts of multiple inputs , breaking them down in logical groups contained inisde tabs with a side real-time preview of the user's data entry experience.

It covers most use-cases of entering data thorugh a form , values beeing validated by angular's built in validoators and custom made validators for  specifit client requirement.
