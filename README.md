## About

My preffered pattern for designing a form that coninsts of multiple inputs , breaking them down into logical groups contained inisde tabs with a real-time preview of the user's data entered

It covers most use-cases of entering data thorugh a form , values beeing validated by angular's built in validoators and custom made validators for specific client requirements.
